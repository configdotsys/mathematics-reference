### Math Notes and References

This repository contains selected technical reference notes compiled as a working reference for applied mathematics concepts used in engineering and technical analysis.

The material is not intended to be a tutorial, textbook, or original theoretical contribution. Instead, it consolidates standard definitions, identities, and mathematical tools commonly used across applied mathematics and technical problem solving.

Notes are organized for clarity and long-term reuse alongside engineering analysis, modeling, and embedded system development.
